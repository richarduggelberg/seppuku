# Seppuku

A mediocre sudoku solver.

Is currently able to solve simpler N x N sudoku puzzles where some squares have only one possible value.

Created att part of my thesis project where the goal is to synthesize property-based tests from an existing test suite.
This repository serves as a possible basis for such experiments.
